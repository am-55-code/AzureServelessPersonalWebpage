# Cloud Resume Challenge
    My own resume and future landing page about myself, using Azure Services.


    ## First Week

    -- Learned a bit of HTML/CSS and made a simple structure from scratch, good enough for now, but improve in styling is needed.

    -- Tried to emulate my actual CV as a website, almost there.

    -- Created an Azure Storage Account and used the Blob service as a static website.

    -- Site is up and running!  https://staticsiteacctest.z15.web.core.windows.net/

    -- Tried to use as much IaC as i can in this moment, created the full deployment using CLI(BlobStorage.sh).

    -- In the future maybe pass all of it to Bicep/ARM, tried a bit(DeployingResources.bicep), need to study more.


    ## Second Week

    API Time!

    -- Created a javascript visitor counter (main.js) and attached to the homepage.
